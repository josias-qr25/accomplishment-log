This Python program tracks your daily accomplishments!

Every day, all of us progress. Every little win in our lives should be celebrated! From anything as little as a bit of exercise in your morning routine, to something as big as completing a college degree. Why not make note of it?

This Python program is very simple. It asks for a title and a note, then automatically saves it with a timestamp. You can then look at all your accomplishments afterwards.

Try it out!

Remember, you can accomplish anything!
